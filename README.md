The Ecommerce Full-stack project is a comprehensive online shopping platform that offers both user and admin functionalities. Users can sign up and sign in, browse products, view them by category, and use search and filters to find desired items. However, to add products to the cart and proceed with purchases, users must log in. The payment process is handled securely via the Stripe payment gateway, and users can view their orders on the order page. Admins can manage the platform by viewing all orders and users, uploading or updating products, and ensuring secure access through JWT authentication. The system provides a robust foundation for building a secure, user-friendly, and fully functional e-commerce website.
